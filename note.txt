I think the best course of action for this program is to have a separate file scanner and multi-file scanner program within this same project.
before pushing strip the code from github and add it to a folder within this main File Scanner folder for the single file scanning and leave the modified code as the multi-file scanner. 
--> also fix the thing with check_hash since its erroneously returning false upon hash match rather than True which is what it should be returning.
